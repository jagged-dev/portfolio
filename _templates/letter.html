                <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
                <p>
                    As a Software Engineer with a passion for developing modern user interfaces and delivering engaging user experiences, I was very excited to find an opening for a [ POSITION ] position at [ COMPANY ]. Your job posting highlighted the importance of usability and visual appeal, both of which are focus
                    points I find incredibly important and always pay close attention to.
                </p>
                <p>I specialize in designing and developing web applications that are performant, user-friendly, and visually appealing. With a strong background in HTML, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, and frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, I hope to become a valuable addition to your team.</p>
                <p>
                    In my former role as Software Engineer Lead at Vikco, I led a team of five engineers to develop and maintain a unique, proprietary SaaS platform. This product was aimed at strengthening business relationships by visualizing, quantifying, and analyzing business value, making it easier to track areas
                    of success as well as areas for improvement. Our tech stack consisted of a Java and Spring Boot backend, an Angular frontend user interface, REST APIs, a JUnit and Selenium automated testing infrastructure, and a Bitbucket and JIRA workflow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I enjoy working on hobby projects that I create in hopes of offering software products that are genuinely useful and easy to use. These projects additionally serve as an outlet for me to express my creative ideas. When planning these projects, I aim to challenge myself by learning
                    and utilizing new programming concepts, which has done well to keep me up to date on emerging technologies and ensure that I am always learning and improving myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What helps me stand me out as a Software Engineer is my keen and organized attention to detail, which applies to all aspects of my work. I always strive to write code that is both highly readable and highly maintainable, which makes development easier for not only myself but also my teammates. I
                    always strive to develop eye-catching user interfaces, with considerable thought put into design consistency and responsiveness. Finally, I always strive to deliver optimal user experiences, with ease-of-use, intuition, and accessibility all in mind.
                </p>
                <p>I would love the opportunity to bring my technical expertise, passion, and attentiveness to your team. Through all of these attributes, I know I can be a valuable team member.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,<br />Jonathan Giang</p>
